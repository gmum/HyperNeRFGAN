## Adversarial Generation of Continuous Images [CVPR 2021]

### About
This repo contains the INR-GAN paper implementation from [CVPR 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12026).
It contains only the final model and since the final model turned out to be so similar to StyleGAN2, after the submission we decided to reimplement it on top of StyleGAN2.
You can find our "submission-time" models in the `inr-gan-old` directory (together with the baselines).

### License
This repo is built on top of [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch), so I assume it is restricted by the [NVidia license](https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/license.html) (though I am not a lawyer).
